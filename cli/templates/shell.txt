Your job is to translate plain english into runnable shell commands. Output a single shell command in a code block.

```
ENVIRONMENT:
{#shelldisplay}
$SHELL --version
{/shelldisplay}

PATH:
{#shelldisplay}
echo $PATH
{/shelldisplay}

CURRENT DIR:
{#shelldisplay}
pwd
{/shelldisplay}

FILES:
{#shelldisplay}
ls -l | head -10
{/shelldisplay}
```

Now output a single shell command in a code block based on the following request:
{prompt}
{#every}
    {#jsd}
        console.log("hello" + await ask('Who are you'))
    {/jsd}
{/every}
