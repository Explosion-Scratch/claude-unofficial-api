Generate markdown flashcards and questions about {prompt} in the following format:

- Front :: back
- Reversable front ::: back

_Note: Flashcards are just markdown bullet points_

Example

## Terms
- Stoichiometry Definition::The study of quantitative relationships between reactants and products in a chemical reaction
- Quantitative Relationships:::Numerical connections between the amounts of substances involved in a reaction.

_Note: Quantitative relationships card contains ":::" instead of "::" to signify that it can be studied reverse order, e.g. the back is shown, then the front_

Now generate 15 flashcards about {prompt}. First outline the important topics, definitions and subjects of {prompt} then write 15 flashcards in markdown bullet points. Use H3 to separate sections of flashcards ("###"). Use simple language and include 2 permutations of each flashcard asking for different details to help remember.
