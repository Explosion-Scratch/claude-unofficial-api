Fundamental Attribution Error: We judge others on their personality or fundamental character, but we judge ourselves on the situation.
  Example: “Sally is late to class; she's lazy. You're late to class; it was a bad morning.”
Self-Serving Bias: Our failures are situational but our successes are our responsibility.
  Example: “You won that award due to hard work rather than help or luck. Meanwhile, you failed a test because you hadn't gotten enough sleep.”

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.630
Howdy and welcome back. This time we're
going to talk about a little bit more

2
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.579
naming than we did the last session.
We're going to talk this time about Covalin

3
00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:24.039
compounds in about acids. So last
time we did ionic compounds. This time

4
00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.070
we're going to do compounds that have
Covalin Bonds. What we're going to look

5
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.060
at this point is just looking at
the names and the formulas. A quick review.

6
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.409
I might throw some terms out there
that you might not remember, and that's

7
00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:39.189
okay, because they're not really important
for this unit. But the more you

8
00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:43.460
can hear things, the better off you will
be later on. So let's take a look

9
00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.700
at first of all, just how we want
to go ahead and name things when you're

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.070
naming Covalin compounds. What we have to
look at here is we're not dealing

11
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.990
with charges anymore. We're dealing with
using prefixes to tell us how many

12
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:04.590
of each atom we're going to be looking
at. So we have prefixes and the prefixes

13
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:14.110
are pretty simple. Mono die, try
And here's where they get a little

14
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.930
different for is tetra five is
Penta like pent oxide Whatever you want to

15
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.769
call there Six hex a like a hexagon seven helped.

16
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:41.629
Eight is Oct like Octagon Like a stop
sign. Nine is non or Nana and 10

17
00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:47.410
is deck like a deck again 10 sided
figure. Okay, so some of these that kind

18
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.310
of end with a or you can
leave it off, depending upon what you're looking

19
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.800
for. So once you have these prefixes,
what you're looking at is each prefix

20
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.230
just tells you how many of each
Adam you're going to have within your compound

21
00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:04.270
and again, prefix means it's happening
at the beginning of the word. So

22
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.750
when you're naming these compounds, you
have a prefix usually and then the

23
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.250
name of the element and then another
prefix, and then you change the ending

24
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.199
toe. I'd just like we did with
the Ionic Compounds. Let's take a look at

25
00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:25.580
a few examples. So the examples I'm
going to do are actually the examples of

26
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.400
compounds that I've created up here. The
first one that we have is this

27
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.910
one right here. The yellow represents
a sulfur atom, and then the green

28
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:44.860
ones represent fluoride atoms. So this is
one sulfur, and then we have 123456

29
00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:55.039
fluoride atoms. So we have s f
six. This one we have one sulfur, six

30
00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:59.650
florins. So the one time that we don't
use a prefix was going to be our very

31
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.110
first example here. We don't use
the prefix mono when you're talking about

32
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:13.960
the very first element in the system.
So this is just sulfur hex, a fluoride.

33
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.610
Okay, so one sulfur don't need the
prefix here for the first element. And

34
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.930
then six, the prefix hex a and
then fluoride notice we change the florin

35
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.080
to fluoride to be the end of the
word there. All right, let's take a look

36
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:40.910
at the next one. This particular compound is B F

37
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.480
or B H three. Sorry, It is
a plainer molecule. It's flat, which means it's

38
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.650
it's all in one plane here on
it's a triangle, So it's tribunal plainer.

39
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.250
It's kind of fun to think about it that
way, but the blue one is a B, and

40
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.640
the white ones are h is. So we
have one boron and three hydrogen. So this

41
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.170
is boron. Three is the prefix try.
And then when hydrogen is that second

42
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.260
element there we change it from
hydrogen toe hydride. So boron try hydride.

43
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:26.990
Let's hit one more example here.
How about water? We want to have something

44
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.839
that doesn't just have a single element in
the front of it. So we have water.

45
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.950
Everybody knows the formula for water. H
20 But the name for water is a

46
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.490
little bit different. So we know water.
That's its common name. But if we

47
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.250
set this thing up and we look at
it, we see that there are two hydrogen

48
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.149
and one oxygen. If we're going to
use the same naming convention that we've

49
00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:54.329
been using, this has a really
different official name than the one we've

50
00:04:54.339 --> 00:05:03.490
been giving it. So this is
to hydrogen. So that's di hydrogen mon

51
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:11.520
oxide. So there we go. Here's the
word. The mon comes into play. So again

52
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.860
we have a prefix and the word and
then a prefix. And then the word with

53
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.850
that I d. E ending at the end of
it. Let's do one or two going the other

54
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:31.680
direction. Here's one of my favorites Tetra

55
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:41.410
phosphorus deck oxide. All right, so
let's take this word apart and see

56
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.990
if we can create the formula from it.
So we have two things going on here.

57
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.570
We have Tetra which means four and
then we know the phosphorus is P. Then

58
00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:04.930
we have deck or Deco. That means 10 and
the oxide is for Oh, so if we take

59
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:12.770
a look at this whole thing, we can
break everything apart. We get P 40 10.

60
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.150
What's kind of neat about this is when
you take this and you put it into

61
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:23.440
water. If you take this compound into
water, it turns into H three po four,

62
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:31.360
which we're going to use as a segue
into Let's talk about some acids. Assets

63
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.320
are pretty neat. So acids are
covalin compounds that in some ways behave

64
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.080
like ionic compounds. This is an example
of an acid. This is nitric acid.

65
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:52.350
It's h and then n in the middle. And
then 03 So H n 03 this is nitric acid.

66
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.200
What's cool about acids is these
air Allco violently bonded together. But

67
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.140
when I take this thing and I stick
it in the water, it loses this hydrogen

68
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:08.970
and this hydrogen goes off and attach
is to a water in a different place

69
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.220
to give me a nitrate ion and a
hydro Nia, my on. So you have this weird

70
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:21.430
chemical reaction where a covalin compound
ends up having a charge. This

71
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.670
becomes the nitrate ion and a three
minus. And this becomes the hydro Nia,

72
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.840
my on h 30 plus, What's kind
of need about these things is because they

73
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.260
have different behaviors. So even though
they're co violent, they have different

74
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:39.420
behaviors. So they have different naming
schemes to assets are a little

75
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:44.920
bit more challenging to work with.
All right, our first example with our

76
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.140
acids, we're going to look at our binary
acids. So just like binary ionic compounds

77
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.120
or binary coagulant compounds, we're only
dealing with two kinds of atoms

78
00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:01.360
here. So for our binary acids, what
we're looking at is to write the formula

79
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:09.250
you're going to use some number of h
is that are going to kind of act as

80
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.700
a positive charge even though there
it's a covalin bond. And then you're

81
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:19.660
going to pair that with an ion, which,
if you don't remember that is a negative

82
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:28.340
ion from the periodic table. So these
were going to be things that are non

83
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:34.620
metals sulfide oxide, fluoride chloride. Any
of those air going to be paired

84
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.510
up here? So that's how we're going to
write the formula you want to balance

85
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:44.090
out The quote charges when we write
the name for a binary ionic camp are

86
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:49.460
a binary acid. What we're dealing with
here is you're going to use the prefix

87
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:56.549
hydro than the root word, and then
you're going to have a Suffolk's IQ and

88
00:08:56.549 --> 00:09:01.650
then the word acid. So hydro something
ic acid. If I just said that your

89
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.390
brain probably went hydrochloric acid because
that's the only one you know,

90
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.880
right, that's the only one that we
always think of. So you might have put

91
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.540
some of that in your pool, or you
might have heard about it from a different

92
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.590
chemistry class. But that's probably the
most common binary acid that we

93
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:22.080
all hear about. And so let's use
that as our first example. Chloride

94
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.880
ion, if you go back to your periodic
table, is in Group seven, so it has

95
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:33.120
a negative one charge. Hydrogen can have
either a positive one or a negative

96
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.070
one charge. So since the chloride is
a negative one, that clearly has to

97
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:43.840
be the positive. And so we have our
compound of HCL, and we use the chloral

98
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:50.960
components to help fill in the gap
for the name and we have hydro chloral

99
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:58.870
IQ acid. And there's our first example. Let's do one more.

100
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:09.490
Let's do hte to s. And I'm going to
make a point about writing a quiz here

101
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:14.510
after this particular molecule. And the
reason for that is without water

102
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:22.910
and acid is just a covalin molecule. So
if I had hte us gas, I would call

103
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:32.700
this di hydrogen sulfide or die
hydrogen mono sulfide is probably more

104
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.320
appropriate. Okay, But as soon as I take
that and I put it into water, it

105
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.880
goes through a chemical reaction and
it dissociates. And so it's behavior

106
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.830
becomes that oven acid. It's different. And
so now when I take a look at

107
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:54.750
this thing now it's an acid,
and I'm going to say hydro sulfuric

108
00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:04.000
acid. There's the route. There's the
prefix. There's the Suffolk six. So

109
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.060
there's the whole thing. Other assets that
you might get that are, um, binary

110
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:16.600
acids would be like Hydrofluoric hydro.
I otik hydro nitric. There are very

111
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:24.990
few, um, acids that are binary that
we use other than the halogen, so that

112
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:31.420
makes it a little bit easier for us.
Okay, so up next we have turn Eri acids

113
00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.790
and there's going to be two different
types of coronary acids. All the turn

114
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:40.630
Eri acids are based on which Polly
Atomic Ion are we working with And what

115
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:44.590
does it end with? So we have we're
going to kind of split this up so that we

116
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:49.660
can see it. So if the an eye on ends with ICT,

117
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.030
What we're going to do with that is
that the name is going to become we're

118
00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:07.220
going to have the route and then it's
going to become owe us acid. Whereas if

119
00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:17.160
the an ion ends with eight, then
we're gonna have the route, and it's beginning

120
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:25.540
to become an I C. Acid or an
IQ acid. The same charge rules apply. You're

121
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.640
still gonna balance out whatever the
negative charges on the anti on with

122
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:34.400
the H is being positive. So let's do
an example for each one of these. So

123
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.180
let's use we use sulfur as an
example for our hydro sulfuric acid. So let's

124
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:46.460
use the next two possible ions. Here
we have the sole fight Ion. So that's

125
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:53.890
s 03 minus two. And then over here
we have the sulfate ion notice the eight

126
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.800
has one more oxygen than the
height. That becomes an important factor a

127
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.380
little bit later on. To get our formula,
we just have to look at the charges

128
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.790
and balance them out with h is Each
of these has a negative to charge on

129
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.350
the Poly Atomic Ion. And so what
we need there is just to balance those

130
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:18.620
out with h is. So we're gonna need
to h is to balance out the negative to

131
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:24.290
over here and same thing on this side
over here. So on this side we have

132
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:29.370
H two s 03 on this side. We have
H two s 04 Same number of H is because

133
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.310
they both have the same charge now
they were They get really different is

134
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:41.080
how we name them. So we change the
ICT ending to oh us, and it becomes so

135
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:50.270
furious acid. And then on this side,
we change the eight ending toe. I

136
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:57.920
see, and it becomes sulfuric acid.
There's a good chance you've heard of

137
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.760
sulfuric acid, but maybe not sulfurous
acid. This one's used a little bit

138
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.380
more commonly and like cleaning
products and in industrial processes. So

139
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:12.150
you're going to be more likely to come
across sulfuric acid than you are. It's

140
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.880
one less oxygen counterpart. So we
have these two things sitting here, and

141
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.960
you're like, Oh, my gosh, How doe I
remember all of this. Well, I have this

142
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.710
really silly little thing that I tell
my kids, Um, and to know I'm telling

143
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:35.670
you because you're my kids and it's
a little sentence. So I ate IQ and

144
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:45.670
got the aight us. So, you know, it's a little bit

145
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:50.270
silly, but it works because you keep
the eight and the it together. So you

146
00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:55.190
have I ate it like, Oh, it's something
bad and they got the itis. So when

147
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.510
you get sick, what do you get?
If you have a pancreatic infection, you get

148
00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:04.390
pancreatitis. If you have a lung
infection, you get bronchitis. So you know,

149
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:09.430
you have this something. You ate something
bad, and it caused this to happen.

150
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:15.780
So I ate it and I got the
itis and it keeps together. The Poly Atomic ion

151
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.010
comes first, and then the Suffolk's for
your acid comes after it. So if

152
00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:25.210
the Poly Atomic ion ends in eight,
your Suffolk's is it. If the Poly atomic

153
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:30.260
ion ends in ICT, your Suffolk's is us.
So let's go backwards so we can see

154
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:37.070
what that's going to look like. A Well,
here's our next two examples. We have

155
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:46.530
H three p 04 and H three p
03 So again, notice there's a single oxygen difference

156
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.290
between these two molecules, and
that's going to be something that's important

157
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.850
in a little while. We need to go
back to our reference sheet, and we need

158
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:58.850
to figure out what the name of each
of these poly atomic ions is. So you

159
00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.220
go back to your handy dandy little
Polly Atomic I in reference sheet. Do

160
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:11.360
that now and you'll see that this is
the Foss fate I on while this is the

161
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:18.830
Foss fight I on. So this one ends
in eight. This one ends tonight. And as

162
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:24.070
you take a look at this, you're like,
Okay, I remember this. I ate IQ, so

163
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:30.010
I got the ICT us. So we're
going to take this phosphorus part right here, and

164
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:39.050
we're going to change that into an
I C. So we have phosphoric acid,

165
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:49.190
and over here the ICT becomes O U s. So we have Foss for us

166
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:54.220
acid, and I'm just going to say I
can't believe I made the words fit where

167
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.010
they were supposed to go. That was
kind of a miracle. All right, so you

168
00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:05.150
got those down. Let's throw some together.
All right, so here we go. Here's

169
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:13.490
a couple of them H N 02 We need
to take a look. We need to know what this

170
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:19.109
Polly Atomic ion is. So we go back to
our sheet, I take a look at it. I

171
00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:27.800
go. Oh, that's n o to minus, which
is the nitrite ion. So I know that ICT

172
00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:36.890
becomes oh, us. And I know that
this becomes nitrous acid. All well and

173
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.890
good. I bet you got it. But there's
one more I want to show you because

174
00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:44.760
it's kind of a weird one. It
doesn't follow the rules just like a whole

175
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:54.450
lot of things in chemistry. And here it is.
H c n. This is a very odd ball

176
00:17:54.450 --> 00:18:03.850
little thing because it contains a poly
atomic ion. But that ion ends in

177
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:10.860
I d. E. So this is like the
one random example where we actually have to

178
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:16.760
go back to treating this almost a
ziff. It was a binary acid. So because

179
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.130
it ends an I d. It doesn't end
a night. It doesn't end in eight. This actually

180
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:30.950
becomes hydro scion IQ acid. So
that's the sort of one seriously random

181
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:35.160
exception. And then the last thing I
want to show you with our acids are

182
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:43.400
the I guess I would call them
the stepwise acids. And they are probably

183
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.520
atomic ions that have increasing numbers
of oxygens. And so we're going to

184
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:54.610
start download. We're going to start with
Cielo minus and then Cielo to minus

185
00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:02.680
cielo three minus and Cielo four
minus. These, if you notice, have increasing

186
00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.060
numbers of oxygen's as you go up. So
what happens is each one of these has

187
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:12.280
to have a slightly different name.
On DSO. We had prefixes and suffixes.

188
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:16.590
In addition to what we already had.
We already saw twice that eight had

189
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:21.830
one more oxygen than I and that's
the case here. So what happens is this

190
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:28.800
one with the Cielo three. That's the
chlorate ion. And so one less is the

191
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.820
chloride ion. Well, now you're like,
Well, there's one less and there's

192
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.940
one more. So what do I do with
those? So have you ever heard of diabetes

193
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:43.180
about the answer is yes. Have you
ever heard of the word hypoglycemia? Do

194
00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:47.840
you know what it means? Yep. It
means low blood sugar. So when the blood

195
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:54.400
sugar gets low, you have a hypo glassy
mia. So we use that same prefix here

196
00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:02.730
to represent a low number of oxygen's.
So this becomes the hypo Clo, right?

197
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:08.360
Ion. Unfortunately, my diabetes example does
not work in the other direction.

198
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.200
But there's something even more fun to
help you with this one. We keep Arklow

199
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:20.210
rate for this Cielo four. But now we
add the prefix Per so it's per chlorate.

200
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.100
Ion and I totally admit that one of
my kids came up with this, but you can

201
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:29.980
all enjoy the effects of it. You
always have a very happy kitty cat when

202
00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:37.540
it has four legs. So it pers, I
know it's really bad, but the per does help

203
00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.360
you remember that is supposed to be
with you. Have something with 04 on

204
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:48.110
it. It's going to be the per eight
ion. Um, this pattern applies for all of

205
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:56.580
the halogen, so you can have x
cielo four minus ex Cielo three minus ex

206
00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:03.660
cielo to minus and ex Cielo minus, and
you can replace that X with any halogen.

207
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:14.160
However, the cool ride ones are the
most commonly seen. I think that's probably

208
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.350
enough for the moment. You've gotten
a lot of good experience with your

209
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:23.720
with your covalin compounds in your acids
here, and I hope to see you next

210
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.960
time. Take care.
